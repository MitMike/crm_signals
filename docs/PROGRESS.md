**Main baseline:** [2e9eb89](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/commit/2e9eb89b8ed5618ca3e50e6bc0b2c867c516e17b)  
**Completed implementation:** PR #19 delivered settings/presets and core idempotency; PR #21 validated the legacy-schema migration; PR #23 closed concurrent API-idempotency and digest-queue races; PR #26 merged the transactional signal outbox; PR #32 merged the standard Frappe Helpdesk D3 adapter; PR #38 merged audited Failed-row replay; PR #42 merged D3 field-level permission hardening; PR #44 merged source-document notification authorization; PR #45 merged per-Company quotation thresholds; PR #49 corrected Company-currency display/fetch.  
**Next acceptance:** complete the target-site Frappe v16.5 pilot: exact app versions, per-Company threshold amounts/currencies, the custom read-only Helpdesk role, D1/D2 reconciliation, Helpdesk SLA calendar, scheduler/mail/realtime, and backup/restore/rollback. CI-verified work is not pilot-verified.

This file is the operational source of truth. [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) is the roadmap, [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) is the durable decision register, [FOLLOW_UPS.md](FOLLOW_UPS.md) tracks deferred issues, and [specs/](../specs/) holds feature contracts.

## Current status

**Sprint update — 2026-11-02:** PR #26 transactional outbox, PR #32 D3 Helpdesk adapter, PR #38 audited Failed-row replay, PR #42 D3 field-level permission guard and PR #44 source-document notification authorization are merged. PR #38 merge commit is `1640bdd496706a7f297b0984f1fd1d9695307147`; PR #42 merge commit is `17eca3f6cb493fb8729632e0902c07ccb776b6a5`; PR #44 merge commit is `48622c08700032566051978076f49bc807c381e7`. ADR-048 records the standard Helpdesk source and Monday–Saturday assumption. ADR-049 sets Frappe v16.5 as the primary target. PR #45 per-company quotation thresholds merged as `ff434bdf407d1d61842d81fae16e04b4b9b483d5`; PR #49 corrected the child-row Currency field to fetch and display each Company's base currency, merged as `2e9eb89b8ed5618ca3e50e6bc0b2c867c516e17b`. Both passed all required checks. Target-site Company amounts/currency policy remain. ADR-053 records that Frappe v16.5.0 realtime queueing is not delivery confirmation; a per-recipient durable ledger with stable IDs, permission rechecks and client dedupe is the revisit design. ADR-054 requires source-document read access before realtime content is queued. ADR-055 adds the path-filtered Frappe/ERPNext v16.5.0 + Helpdesk compatibility CI target; ADR-056 preserves Helpdesk read-only boundaries and recommends a custom role for Sales; ADR-057 supersedes its v1.30.2 reference after the framework UI dependency was exposed. PR #50 now pins Helpdesk v1.28.0: v1.29.0/v1.30.2 asset builds fail against the unmodified Frappe v16.5.0 tag because `@framework/ui` links to the absent `frappe/ui` package; v1.31.1 additionally requires the absent `Notification Type` DocType. The first attempt also exposed a malformed MariaDB client config, corrected with a here-doc. The first v1.30.2 install succeeded. The schema smoke initially used `Meta.has_field` for Frappe's system `creation` column; it now uses `frappe.db.has_column`. The next run showed `bench execute` had no explicit Administrator session, so the real D3 aggregate smoke test marked all measures unavailable; the helper now sets Administrator before invoking the API. The v1.30.2 run passed Helpdesk installation, schema/role checks and the real D3 aggregate smoke test, then failed in Helpdesk's after-migrate asset build because `@framework/ui` cannot resolve. The v1.28.0 reference lane is now running. No target-site acceptance has been recorded.

## Completed reliability hardening — PR #23

- Fixes the real unique-key race: after both API requests observe an event key as absent, the losing insert now reloads the winning CRM Signal with `for_update=True` so MariaDB repeatable-read cannot hide the row behind an older snapshot.
- Adds a deterministic Bench test using two independent database connections. The expected result is one CRM Signal, one created response, one deduplicated response and one notification dispatch.
- Serializes digest recipient claims by locking the CRM Signals Settings singleton and rechecking the queued-recipient marker before each email queue request. The lock and marker update share the same transaction as that recipient's Email Queue write.
- Adds a two-worker Bench test asserting one queue request for a recipient/date.
- **Status:** merged to `main` as `d75b7f3`. [Bench v15/v16 + Playwright](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41300667892), [Quality Checks](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41300667996) and [Security Scanning](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41300667997) passed on PR head `7ed0860`. No target-site mail/scheduler acceptance is implied.

## Completed engineering task — legacy schema upgrade rehearsal

- PR #21 adds a disposable Bench scenario to both Frappe v15 and v16 lanes: create two historical CRM Signal rows, remove the newer source-event identity columns and DocField metadata, run the real `bench migrate`, then verify the current schema returns and both legacy rows remain intact with null event keys.
- The test deliberately exercises Frappe DocType synchronization. An empty `crm_signals/patches.txt` is not treated as a defect; a custom patch will be added only if migration evidence requires one.
- Status: **passed** on Frappe v15 and v16 in PR #21. The final head `3578dd566683d2dff4c9f663b733e838b6627e25` passed Quality Checks, Bench Integration and E2E, and Security Scanning. The merge commit is `72833cd383811d7c9be591206647b2e0b1f3fbd9`. This does not replace target-site upgrade, backup, restore and rollback rehearsal.

## Repository governance

GitHub ruleset [Protect main](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/rules/26282133) is active on `refs/heads/main`.

- Pull requests required; direct main updates, deletion and force pushes are blocked.
- Eight strict required contexts cover lint/static checks, Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.14, Semgrep and Bench v15/v16.
- Review threads must be resolved. Required approving review count is zero to avoid deadlocking a single-maintainer repository.
- No bypass actors are configured. Emergency recovery requires an authorized administrator to temporarily edit and then restore the ruleset.
- Dependency Security Audit is active, but is not one of the eight required branch contexts.

[Issue #12](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/issues/12) was closed after ruleset verification.


## Durable transactional signal outbox — PR #26 merged

- PR [#26](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/pull/26) merged to `main` as `b0364a74affa823977af74d1907781d1533e60c0`.
- Final synchronized head: `222e70ec71164dab4448f7319525042323a357b4` (based on main after PR #28).
- Quality Checks, Security Scanning and Bench Integration/E2E all passed on that exact head; Bench covered Frappe v15/v16 and the concurrent enqueue/process idempotency cases.
- Source events and outbox rows commit atomically; delivery is queued after commit, with the scheduled pending-event worker retained as recovery. Retry is bounded and terminal failures are visible to System Managers.
- **Still open:** audited operator replay for terminal Failed rows (PR #38 merged) and durable realtime notification retry. These are not included in the merged outbox scope.

## Stage 1 — release readiness and core hardening

### Completed in merged code
- D1 active Lead/Opportunity counts, stages and active pipeline become unavailable when status metadata is missing rather than incorrectly counting all rows as active.
- D2 Sales Invoice metrics that exclude returns require `is_return`; no return-sensitive aggregation runs without that filter.
- Payment Entry receipt metrics remain independent of Sales Invoice return metadata.
- Branch protection and file/function size standards are merged.

### Implemented and merged in PR #19
- Add System Manager-only CRM Signals Settings singleton and editable Balanced, Sales Focused and Executive presets.
- Configure master/external-ingestion/Quotation/Opportunity/digest switches, Company-currency threshold, Opportunity status list, stale-day window, digest time and extra recipients validated against registered enabled System Users.
- Add source-event metadata and a unique hash-based identity for CRM Signals.
- Make webhook retries idempotent when the caller supplies a stable `source_event_id`.
- Schedule the digest at the configured System Settings timezone, query CRM rows under each recipient's user context, send separate permission-filtered emails and record each queued recipient in the same transaction as that email-queue request.
- Remove hard-coded INR formatting and isolate realtime notification errors by recipient.
- Filter realtime recipients by the linked Lead/Customer read permission before sending signal content; denied/failed permission checks are excluded (ADR-034).
- Also require CRM Signal document read permission; add a real FrappeTestCase for both checks and run it with `bench run-tests --app crm_signals` on v15 and v16.
- Align list-query access with direct-document access: owner-only visibility is restricted to unlinked signals; linked signals require a permission-readable owned/assigned parent (ADR-035).
- Add a generic deployment/rollback runbook; actual target-site backup/restore rehearsal remains a P0 acceptance gate.
- Record a production-readiness audit with fixed findings, outstanding P0/P1 risks and an explicit not-ready-for-sign-off decision in docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_AUDIT.md.
- Default the master switch and external ingestion to disabled, including missing-settings fallback, until System Manager explicitly activates the reviewed configuration (ADR-036).
- Bound daily digest quotation output to 100 rows with an explicit truncation notice to prevent unbounded email payloads (ADR-037).
- Add Bench-backed webhook and database tests for same-user duplicate POSTs, one notification per event, per-user namespaces, unique-key enforcement and multiple legacy null keys; concurrent insert and true pre-feature upgrade migration remain open.
- CI follow-up (2026-11-01): Bench v15/v16 exposed an invalid CRM Signal autoname expression that persisted the literal `SIG-.YYYY.-.#####`; corrected to Frappe's brace-delimited `format:SIG-{YYYY}-{#####}` (ADR-038). The API integration test now sets request form data after switching users because the user-context switch clears the local request form.
- CI follow-up (2026-11-01): Bench v16 exposed the changed document-permission hook contract: it passes `ptype` and requires an explicit boolean. Updated the hook to accept both v15/v16 argument names and preserve role-level DocType permissions before row-level restrictions (ADR-039). Corrected duplicate-key recovery to handle Frappe's `UniqueValidationError` using a locking read, added a race-recovery regression test, and changed notification idempotency coverage to count one dispatch rather than assume one realtime recipient. Prettier formatting was corrected and its temporary diagnostic step removed. These changes passed the final v15/v16 Bench matrices, Playwright, Python, lint and security checks before PR #19 merged.
- CI follow-up (2026-11-01): The first v16 Playwright run exposed a login race: the session cookie existed before Frappe completed the redirect, causing subsequent API/navigation actions to overlap with that redirect and trigger aborted requests and CSRF errors. The shared login helper now waits for the version-appropriate Desk URL; the settings custom-preset handler awaits its form-model update and the E2E test blurs the integer field before asserting. See ADR-040. The corrected v16 Playwright suite passed on final PR head `a90315be7ef37e2dceeacb9b4e9b77d5d31df131`.
- Add an admin guide, settings/reliability spec and configuration/identity/digest tests.

### Target-site acceptance — still required
- [ ] Run Frappe Pilot import on the intended site and record installed Frappe/ERPNext versions and applications.
- [ ] Confirm Company default currency and verify quotation threshold behavior for every enabled Company.
- [ ] Confirm Opportunity status values and terminal Lead statuses from actual workflows.
- [ ] Confirm site timezone, digest time and recipients.
- [ ] Validate Sales User, Sales Manager, System Manager and non-sales roles in list, direct form, API, report, export and print paths.
- [ ] Reconcile D2 invoice, Payment Entry receipt, POS receipt and receivable figures against native ERPNext reports, by currency.
- [ ] Configure a dedicated integration user, API credentials, TLS, gateway rate limiting, monitoring and secret rotation.
- [ ] Exercise scheduler, mail queue, realtime notifications, migration, backup and rollback on the intended site.

## Explicitly deferred

See [FOLLOW_UPS.md](FOLLOW_UPS.md) for issues that should not be silently treated as complete:
- Durable realtime notification retry; audited terminal Failed-row replay merged in PR #38.
- Multi-company quotation thresholds merged in PR #45; target-site Company amounts and exact-currency fallback approval remain; no implicit FX conversion.
- D3 field-level permission hardening and target-site acceptance; H privacy/consent decisions, E integration inventory, V retention and A metric-registry work.

## Completed branch work — PR #21

- PR #21 adds a disposable Frappe v15/v16 rehearsal for upgrading historical CRM Signal rows from the pre-source-event-identity schema.
- First rehearsal attempts failed because Frappe's stored DocType `migration_hash` still matched the current JSON, so the importer skipped the schema import even after the timestamp rewind.
- The fixture now clears that hash and rewinds the DocType timestamp before `bench migrate` (ADR-042). This is a CI fixture correction; the final migration rehearsal passed on both supported Frappe versions.
- Latest fix commit: `acc096879841286afa61073571fbe40eea473fd4`. PR #21 is merged as `72833cd383811d7c9be591206647b2e0b1f3fbd9`.

## CI and release evidence

PR #23 was merged to `main` as `d75b7f3591d2a863b0af6b8f88ad2a91e9bfd25f` after all required checks passed on final PR head `7ed0860fd45cdc152bb2dcc868489d46b69aefb9`: [Bench Integration and E2E, v15/v16 + Playwright](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41300667892), [Quality Checks](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41300667996), [Security Scanning](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41300667997). API idempotency and digest concurrency regression tests passed on both supported Frappe versions. The earlier PR #21 legacy-schema migration rehearsal also passed; target-site upgrade/restore/rollback remains open.

PR #21 was merged after all required checks passed on final head `3578dd566683d2dff4c9f663b733e838b6627e25`. Quality Checks, Bench Integration and E2E (Frappe v15/v16), and Security Scanning passed. The legacy-schema upgrade rehearsal is complete at CI level; target-site upgrade/restore/rollback remains open.

PR #19 was validated on head `a90315be7ef37e2dceeacb9b4e9b77d5d31df131` and merged as `a49591947a89b011cc1770be176c1f11571b131b`. [Quality Checks](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41274491111), [Bench Integration and E2E](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41274491113) and [Security Scanning](https://github.com/MitMike/crm_signals/actions/runs/41274491117) passed; all 16 check-runs on that head reported success, including Frappe/ERPNext v15 and v16 and the v16 Playwright suite.

CI is necessary, not production acceptance. Never mark a target-site gate complete based only on a mocked unit test or the existence of source code.

## Update protocol

3. Add tests for the acceptance criteria.
4. Update [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible or operationally significant changes.
5. Reconcile this file after merge and attach commit/CI evidence.
6. Put blocked or intentionally deferred work in [FOLLOW_UPS.md](FOLLOW_UPS.md), with an owner/trigger and reason.


## D3 adapter merged — Frappe Helpdesk

- Merge: PR #32 as `43fddfbbc46cac277a48c840251a7a2c963a8eb5`; CI verified on Frappe v15/v16.
- Source schema verified against Helpdesk v1.28.0 reference: HD Ticket, HD Ticket Status, HD Service Level Agreement; ticket fields include status_category, resolution_date, resolution_time, sla and agreement_status at permlevel 0. Later Helpdesk releases may move fields to higher levels.
- API aggregates ticket creation, current Open/Paused backlog, resolved cohort, native resolution duration and SLA fulfilled/failed outcomes. Ticket and SLA permissions are checked independently; payload contains no ticket subjects, comments, contacts or identifiers.
- SLA outcome counts use the same rolling 30-day created-ticket cohort; only Fulfilled/Failed are eligible. No-SLA tickets are counted separately.
- Monday–Saturday is the agreed business-week assumption; configured Helpdesk SLA hours and holiday lists are not overridden.
- Field-level fail-closed permission guard merged in PR #42; exact Frappe v16.5.0/ERPNext v16.5.0/Helpdesk v1.28.0 CI is in PR #50 and is running the pinned install plus real aggregate smoke test. The first run exposed a malformed MariaDB client config; the here-doc correction is in place.
- Remaining: capture the pilot site's exact app versions, configure the approved custom read-only Helpdesk role for Sales, and verify the active SLA calendar, hours and holiday list.
